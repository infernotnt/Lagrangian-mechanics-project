# Lagrangian-mechanics-project

Simulation of a ball on a spinning frictionless ring. One of the motivations for the simulation was looking for stable points for the ball on the ring. The simulation was done using only Numpy, and the visualization was done using Matplotlib.

The problem description and all the analysis and visualization as well as the actual report can be found in the `report.pdf` file.
